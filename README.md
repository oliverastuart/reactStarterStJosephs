This repository is specifically created for St Josephs online session

Steps:

1. Download Node.js from Nodejs.org and install it on your system ( go for default settings)
2. Go to cmd and type npm install â€“g create-react-app (This will globally install the script so that next time from anywhere if you use Npx create-react-app it will atomatically download the node modules and do the initial setup for you).
3. Npx create-react-app testing (here testing is the name of the project).
4. Open the project in vscode(You can either open the testing folder which was created after successful completion of the above command, or else you can open the folder from files in vs code)
5. Npm start to start the project.(once your project is ready and opened in vs code, you can give this command to run the project locally on your system. You can type npm start in vs code terminal itself)
6. npm install react-router-dom ( This is package used to define routes)
7. npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled (This is the package used by material ui for text field and button controls, there is no compulsion for using this, there are other options like antd, mantine ui, etc.)
8. npm install @mui/icons-material @mui/material @emotion/styled @emotion/react (This package is used for material ui icons)

Extentions Used in vs code:

1. ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets (This extension is used in vs code for using shortcuts like rfc. Which helps quickly initialize class)
2. ESLINT ( used to throw warnings if there is mistake in code or in cases where the user has defined a variable and not used it in the class)
3. Prettier (Used for formatting the code properly on click of ctrl + s . after installing change the default document formatting on vs code to prettier and check the option to format the code on click of ctrl+s)
